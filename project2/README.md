In order to solve the questions above, we take three methods: Rule-based strategy, Reinforcement-learning strategy and Imitation- learning strategy. In short, for each method, we have respectively done the following works:

1. Rule-based: Manually design rules and teach the model to follow the rules (just like human playing)

2. RL: Use Deep Q Network (DQN) architecture, introduce the expert experience and design a reward function

3. IL: Add data, replace the origin backbone with UNet and manually add rules to prevent totally wrong decisions
